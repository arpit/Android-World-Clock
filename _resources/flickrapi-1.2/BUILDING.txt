To build flickrj you must download the source code from CVS.

flickrj is built with Ant.  Install the current version of Ant, cd into the 
flickrj/api directory downloaded from CVS and type 'ant'.

You should be able to build flickrj with either JDK 1.4 or 1.5. 
The default distribution is built to JDK 1.4.  This can now be changed by
editing the build.properties and changing the javac.source and javac.target to 
the desired target VM.  

To execute tests cd into flickrj/api/test and type 'ant test'.
